            the work environment, have work experience, and also on-the-job
            training at their organization for a fixed period of time; in
            exchange for the employer benefiting from the studentâ€™s services in
            support tasks. So an internship is basically an exchange of services
            by the intern for experience with the organization.

      Current times necessitate the use of virtual offices and virtual jobs,
      particularly with the advent of Covid-19 and the subsequent various safety
      restrictions.

      Online Internship also known as Remote Internship or Virtual Internship is
      a work experience program where the participant gains experience while
      working in a remote setting through a computer or telephone, and is not
      physically present at the job location. It is a work experience that takes
      place online instead of commuting into an office each day. This means
      working, handling projects, taking phone calls and having meetings, all
      from anywhere you are once you have an internet connection and can
      communicate with your employer through a range of online resources and key
      communication platforms.
