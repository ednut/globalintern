            An <strong>internship</strong> is an opportunity an employer gives
            to a student who is looking to gain relevant skills and experience,
            have exposure to the work environment, have work experience, and
            also on-the-job training at their organization for a fixed period of
            time; in exchange for the employer benefiting from the studentâ€™s
            services in support tasks. So an internship is basically an exchange
            of services by the intern for experience with the organization.
