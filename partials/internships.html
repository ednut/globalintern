            An <strong>internship</strong> is an opportunity an employer gives
            to a student who is looking to gain relevant skills and experience,
            have exposure to the work environment, have work experience, and
            also on-the-job training at their organization for a fixed period of
            time; in exchange for the employer benefiting from the studentâ€™s
            services in support tasks. So an internship is basically an exchange
            of services by the intern for experience with the organization.

            Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that
            recruit interns on behalf of the Companies. This is a key role of
            Global Interns.

      What is Remote Internship?
    </div>
    <p>
      Current times necessitate the use of virtual offices and virtual jobs,
      particularly with the advent of Covid-19 and the subsequent various safety
      restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online Internship also known as Remote Internship or Virtual Internship is
      a work experience program where the participant gains experience while
      working in a remote setting through a computer or telephone, and is not
      physically present at the job location. It is a work experience that takes
      place online instead of commuting into an office each day. This means
      working, handling projects, taking phone calls and having meetings, all
      from anywhere you are once you have an internet connection and can
      communicate with your employer through a range of online resources and key
      communication platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global Interns prepares students and graduates for the new digital
      workspace through virtual internships, giving a first-hand experience of
      remote working with, and in, reputable businesses. We help position you

      Why consider this?
    </div>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Accessibility and Flexibility</strong>: You can work from
        wherever you are, at your own time, once you have a computer or phone
        with an internet connection. Online internship work eliminates the task
        of getting to a physical office and back.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Competitive edge</strong>: Competition for entry-level job
        openings is very high. To be noticed, your Resume needs to stand out and
        it surely will if it reads that you have work experience through online
        internship.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finances</strong>: An online internship gives you the
        opportunity to work and also save money used on transportation. Moreso,
        some companies even pay interns a token amount.
